I just registered the domain [http://ianmoriarty.com](http://ianmoriarty.com) for this page.  The idea of this site will be a collection of things that I do.  That is, display stuff I'm currently working on as well as social networking stuff that I think is currently cool.  Right now that happens to be [twitter](http://twitter.com/iann) and [instagram](http://instagr.am).

In addition to adding this new content I'm going to have to port all of my old [tumblr](http://imor.tumblr.com/) pages onto this new blog.  Which leads to another thing, I am now blogging with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [github pages](http://pages.github.com).  This is working out really nice for me because I already have a github [account](http://github.com/iann) and I get to write just plain text with [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in my text editor of choice, namely [vim](http://www.vim.org/).
